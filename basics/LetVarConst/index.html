    <h1>Let Var Const</h1>
    <p>
        before es6 var is use widely
        <br>
        after es6 var is not preferd to use insted of var use let keyword
        <br>
        when var is declared it can also redeclared and redfine & also if var of globle is changed in other block it reflects to gloal var change <br>
        example variable b as ram and sita<br>
        variable c is defined as let so that can not redfine variable c <br>
        and also inside if block c is again created but not throw error because it is block levet variable <br>
        c inside ifblock did not change that c variable that is outside of the block......<br>
        c can not be redfine but can change data od that variable as singh to sighala<br>
        talking about const it neither be refine and nor be redeclared and be declared at definition time
